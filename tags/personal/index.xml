      <description>Welcome to my blog! I have been working in Financial Risk Management for the last 10+ years in financial instiutions for both Funds and Insurance.
For the last two years I have started to code quite regularly in R and I have now decided to open my little blog to share any insight I will get during my studying.
I will write about risk management and financial applications.
Enough talking about me…let’s start!</description>
